Data-Entry is hard work. This module makes it easier by finding missing artwork for your actors. It scans your entire Foundry world (including modules and system files) for image files that match the names of your actors.  If it finds a match (e.g. Actor "Goblin King" -> File "goblin_king.png"), it offers to replace the artwork for you.
